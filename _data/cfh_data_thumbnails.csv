1858’s American sizing. In today’s it would be a size 4, putting the wearer’s age around 1 year-old. A “boy’s shoe” is listed in ""Appendix B Objects from Cabin 1,"" which is likely referring to this particular nailed sole because the list is comprised of objects deemed of “European or American make."" Additionally, I can make an educated guess as to whose shoe this might have been. Malouf's Hidatsa informant, Adlai Stevenson, thought Cabin 1 might have belonged to Different Cherries, the second wife to Black Hawk, and according to digitized census data, Different Cherries had two children aged 3-12 (George) and 1-10 (Nellie) growing up at Crow-Flies-High Village.

Philadelphia, a major military contractor of uniforms and insignia since the 1820s. The specific makers mark on this button dates between 1867-1893. Due to the small size, the button was probably part of a uniform coat or hat during this time. When Crow-Flies-High’s band initially left the reservation in 1872, they moved near the confluence of the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers, where Fort Buford, a U.S. Army Post, was located. The Arikara were known to be reliable Indian Scouts and even fought in the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876. Some Hidatsa also enlisted as scouts, and after cross-referencing Malouf’s list of members of Crow-Flies-High Band with known Indian Scouts, two individuals have the proper ages to have lived at Crow-Flies-High Village while or after being scouts: Foolish Bear born 1844 (who would’ve been his 40s) and Drags Wolf born 1862 (who was in his 20s). Perhaps either of these two menoffered a button from his coat or hat to the children of the village who then removed the front and center of the button to create its four-spoked wheel shape for a toy cart.
